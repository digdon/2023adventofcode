# Advent of Code 2023

Every year I tell myself that I'm going to use/learn a new language for AoC and every year I run out of time and just resort to Java. But this year I'm committed to using Go as much as I can. I'm literally learning the language as I go, so I'm likely to write code that isn't as efficient, elegant, or follows standard Go practices as it could/should. Hopefully the code will improve as the month progresses.
